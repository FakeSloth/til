# Today I Learned

We are constantly learning new things. This is a repo to share our learnings.
TILs are short Markdown documents (a few sentences + example code) explaining a
new concept, bit of syntax, command, or tip that we've learned.

# Contributing

When you learn something, add a Markdown file to this repo explaining it in concise terms. Place the file in a directory which best describes the content of the tip. Create a new directory if no existing one fits.

Make your own branch and push it to the repo. Open a pull request for review.
