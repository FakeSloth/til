# Today I Learned

We are constantly learning new things. This is a repo to share our learnings.
TILs are short Markdown documents (a few sentences + example code) explaining a
new concept, bit of syntax, command, or tip that we've learned.

# Contributing

When you learn something, add a Markdown file to this repo explaining it in 
concise terms. Place the file in a directory which best describes the content 
of the tip. Create a new directory if no existing one fits.

Make your own branch and push it to the repo. Open a pull request for review.

## Writing a good a TIL

TIL's should be a focused and concise piece of knowledge that's interesting and
worth sharing with others.

Here's some guidelines on how to write a great TIL:

* Avoid writing more than 60 lines of content.
* Avoid writing more than 2 examples.
* Avoid going into too much detail.

If you find TIL straying from these guidelines consider narrowing the scope of
your TIL or writing a blog post on the subject.
